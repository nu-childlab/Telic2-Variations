# Telic2-Variations
Variations on the second Telic experiment, programmed in Matlab R2015a. Telic 2v2 is currently being run. Telic 2v3 and 2v4 are waiting for review.

These experiments also use Psychtoolbox version 3.0.12. For more information, see [the github page](https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3).

#Telic Experiments
More information on this experiment and others can be found at [the Telic experiment github page](https://github.com/nu-childlab/Telic/blob/master/README.md)

##Telic 2v2
In Telic 2v2, the events stimuli incorporate the spatial gaps and rotation that the original image stimuli had.

##Telic 2v3
In addition to the gaps and rotation added in 2v2, Telic 2v3 incorporates a randomized starting point. The natural breaks condition creates multiple pieces of the same shape, as it did in previous experiments, but these shapes are not necessarily shaped like petals.

#Telic 2v4
In addition to the changes from both 2v2 and 2v3, Telic 2v4 adds an additional break point to the natural condition. This makes it so the figure is split into n+1 segments of equal length, where n is the number of loops in the figure.
